Q(1) Start your TCP client application without the TCP server running. What happens? Why?
Ans(1) The following error is displayed- 'Connection failed: Connection refused.' TCP protocol 
requires that each client makes a connection to the server, and does not allow data transfer till then.
In this way there is no loss of packets. Therefore the connection fails when client is started without server running.

Q(2) Start your UDP client application without the UDP server running. What happens? Why?

Ans(2) No error is displayed. The client program starts running even if it has not connected to server. 
It accepts the first expression but does not return any output. In UDP, the client does not form a 
connection with the server like in TCP and instead sends a datagram. Similarly, the server need not 
accept a connection and just waits for datagrams to arrive. Datagrams upon arrival contain the address 
of the sender which the server uses to send data to the correct client. UDP is a fire-and-forget protocol 
that just sends datagrams with no expectation that the other side even receives the datagrams.
